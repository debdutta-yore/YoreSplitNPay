// ## Developer notes
//
// This should actually be an internal interface. It is public because public APIs implement this.
// Anyways, this enforces some level of uniformity for all CRUD APIs. However, we should try to
// keep the contract loose to allow for the most flexibility. Who knows? Consumers might find some
// use for this. There is no howto page for this until we can find an official use for it.

     * `Application` is alive because there is a reference to it via this registry!
     *
